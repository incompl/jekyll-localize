A simple internationalization / localization plugin for "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/

To get started, put @localize.rb@ in your @_plugins@ folder.

Add a @translations@ folder to your project with files named @en.yaml@, @es.yaml@, etc.

In your "Liquid":http://liquidmarkup.org/ templates, put these little buggers everywhere:

@
{% localize global.body %}
@

See the @example@ directory for a working example.
